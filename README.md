# Algorithms
# Objective
A comparative study on the asymptotic analysis of various sorting algorithms, tested with sorted input, descending order input and randomly generated input of varying size.

Testing Environment Specifications:
OS: MacOS High Sierra
Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7
Memory: 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 530 1536 MB
Language: Java 9.0.1
Compiler Version: javac 9.0.1

# Experimental Approach:
Sorting algorithms considered:
•    Insertion sort
•    Merge sort
•    Heap sort
•    Java utility sort
Inputs chosen:
Insertion and Merge sort: Inputs of size ranging from 5000 to 640000(taken in multiples of 2)
Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Utility Sort: The input size ranging from 0.1 million to 12.4 million (taken in multiples of 2)
The types inputs are:
1.    Ascending order input (sorted)
2.    Descending Order input (Sorted in reverse order)
3.    Random inputs (distribution of data not known)
